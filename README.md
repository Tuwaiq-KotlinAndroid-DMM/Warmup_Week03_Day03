# HelloToast App
## What you'll do
- Create an app and add two `Button` elements and a `TextView` to the layout.
- Manipulate each element in the `ConstraintLayout` to constrain them to the margins and other elements.
- Change UI element attributes.
- Edit the app's layout in XML.
- Extract hardcoded strings into string resources.
- Implement click-handler methods to display messages on the screen when the user taps each `Button`.


## The HelloToast app consists of two Button elements and one TextView. When the user taps the first Button, it displays a short message (a Toast) on the screen. Tapping the second Button increases a "click" counter displayed in the TextView, which starts at zero.

## Here's what the finished app looks like:
